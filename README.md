# UE4_RPG_Preview

This is a limited C++ sample of my personal UE4 (now UE5) game project. The CombatSystem and StoryScene code is the most important in this sample. Blueprints have not been uploaded, I've only uploaded the C++ base code. I have a few screenshots here, and also at https://github.com/josephgu2003/JosephGuHighlights. More modern visualizations are available upon request.
